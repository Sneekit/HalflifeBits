# HalflifeBits
This java program takes input from a geiger counter and uses it to generate true randomness, and provides some simple functions for choosing numbers randomly.

It uses the pi4j library to access the GPIO pins. Sample applications from pi4j can be found here: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-v1/tree/master/pi4j-example/src/main/java
